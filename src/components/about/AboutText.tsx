            <p>Hi, I'm Irakli, a React Developer with experience creating user-friendly and efficient web pages. Here's
                a little more about me:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b className='coloredText2'>Experience:</b> without commercial, but have already developed functional web pages with
                    cross-browser and cross-platform compatibility. I've worked on projects where I developed features
                    to enhance the user experience, and I have experience using graphic design applications such as
                    Adobe Photoshop.
                </li>
                <li> <b className='coloredText2'>React Skills:</b> I have a good understanding of the key concepts of React, including component-based
                    architecture (with a focus on functional components using Hooks), state management, and the React
                    ecosystem as a whole.
                </li>
                <li> <b className='coloredText2'>Learning:</b> I'm always eager to learn new skills and improve my existing ones. I train my JavaScript
                    skills with real tasks on platforms like Codewars, and I have good problem-solving skills.
                    Additionally, I'm a fast learner and my English level is B2.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p> Thanks for taking the time to get to know me a little better. I'm excited to connect with you and
                discuss
                how I can contribute to your team.
            </p>
